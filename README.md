# Senya 1st Landing

A gated, animation-led launch experience for the Senya clothing brand that converts pre-launch
curiosity into a contact list. See [`CLAUDE.md` §1](CLAUDE.md) for the full framing and
[`architecture/00-overview.md`](architecture/00-overview.md) for the technical shape.

**Hosted on:** GitHub, deployed on Vercel.

## Running the app

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run typecheck  # strict TS, project-wide
npm run lint
npm run test        # vitest
npm run build       # production build
```

Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and fill in real values before running anything that
touches the data seam or the code gate. Stack and architecture: [`architecture/00-overview.md`](architecture/00-overview.md).

## Where things live

This repo is run with a plan-first, single-source-of-truth operating system. Start here:

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — orientation: what we're building, how we decide, how to operate.
- **[PROJECT-STATUS.md](PROJECT-STATUS.md)** — the live status board. **Read it first to know where
  things stand.** It owns status; it links to everything else.
- **[architecture/](architecture/)** — the Architecture Specification (the *why*) + the ADR log.
- **[backlog/](backlog/)** — the sequenced epic/story plan (the *what next*).
- **[OPEN-QUESTIONS.md](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md)** — decisions blocked on info someone has to go get.
- **[TECH-DEBT.md](TECH-DEBT.md)** — deliberate shortcuts, each with a paydown trigger.
- **[handoffs/](handoffs/)** — the session journal (resume a chat without replaying the transcript).

## The lifecycle

Every new product idea, then all application code, flows through four gates (skills under
`.claude/skills/`): **`product-check`** (shape the requirement, place it in the backlog) →
**`tech-planning`** (approved story) → **`tech-build`** (implement only that increment) →
**`tech-qa`** (independent done-done pass, and the only one that merges). Status moves on the board
in the same commit; a `.githooks/pre-commit` guard backstops it. On a fresh clone, activate the hook
once:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Build cockpit

A zero-dependency progress view, generated from the board + backlog:

```sh
node cockpit/generate.mjs   # writes cockpit/index.html, then open it
```
