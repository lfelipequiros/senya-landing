# Senya 1st Landing SDLC guard — the shared predicate. Keep the status board honest.
#
# This script is the SINGLE source of the rule, invoked by BOTH the local `pre-commit`
# hook and the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/board-guard.yml`), so the two can never
# drift apart.
#
# Usage: pipe `git diff --name-status` output on stdin (STATUS<TAB>PATH per line).
#   git diff --cached --name-status --diff-filter=ACMRD ... | sh githooks/status-guard.sh   (local)
#   git diff --name-status --diff-filter=ACMRD base...HEAD | sh githooks/status-guard.sh     (CI)
# Exit 0 = clean; exit 1 = a violation, with the reason.
#

# WHY THIS IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS.
#
# The board used to hold full narrative per story, so "a commit that touches backlog/ or
# app code must also touch the board" was a decent proxy for "the board is probably still
# true." Once the board holds ONE STATUS TOKEN per open story (see PROJECT-STATUS.md),
# that proxy breaks: refining a plan, adding build notes, repairing a link — all change
# backlog/ and have zero status impact, and cannot touch the board without re-inflating
# the very surface the new shape emptied. A guard that fires on routine, status-free work
# is a guard people learn to `--no-verify`, and a guard people learn to bypass is already
# dead.
#
# So the proxy is replaced by the real thing. Two changes:
#
#   1. The board requirement now fires on a STATUS EVENT, not on any `backlog/` byte:
#        · source code changed          — code moves a story's status, always has
#        · a story file was ADDED       — a new story must be registered
#        · a story file was DELETED     — a story leaving must be accounted for
#      Editing an EXISTING story file requires nothing. That is the whole difference,
#      and it is why this guard doesn't cry wolf on ordinary planning work.
#
#   2. `board:check` runs on every changeset that touches a tracker surface at all. The
#      old write-proxy guard could only ever prove the board was WRITTEN. This proves it
#      is TRUE — ids resolve, nothing is open and closed at once, statuses are in
#      vocabulary, indexes stay indexes, every link lands. That is a strictly stronger
#      guarantee than the proxy it replaces.

# STATUS<TAB>PATH. For a rename git emits `R100<TAB>old<TAB>new` — take the LAST field as
# the path so a renamed story file is judged at its destination.
changed=$(printf '%s\n' "$input" | awk -F'\t' 'NF{print $NF}')

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rule 0 — the trackers stay plain text: no NUL bytes, no CRLF.
#
# A single NUL byte makes git classify a text file as BINARY, which silently turns
# off .gitattributes' `eol=lf` normalization and makes grep refuse to print matches
# from it. CRLF in a repo pinned to LF produces whole-file phantom diffs. Both are
# invisible in a rendered markdown preview and produce thousand-line phantom diffs
# in review — cheap to check here, so the class never gets a chance to surface.
#
# `tr -d` + `cmp` keeps this POSIX — no grep -P, no shell escapes for control chars.
