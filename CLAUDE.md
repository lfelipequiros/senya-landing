# Senya 1st Landing — Project Instructions

> Orientation document for any Claude instance working in this repo.
> Read this first. It defines what we're building, how we decide, and how to operate.

## 0. Nested `CLAUDE.md` Precedence

*(Only relevant once this project has more than one app/package, each with its own `CLAUDE.md` —
skip this section entirely for a single-app project.)*

A nested `CLAUDE.md` (inside an app or package directory) and this root file can disagree, and both
are read. The rule: **the app-level file wins for that app's own internals** (its framework
conventions, its file layout, its local testing quirks); **this root file wins for cross-app
strategy** (the value model, the decision principles, which app owns which seam, the delivery
contract below). Neither silently overrides the other.

- **Conflicts get surfaced, not resolved by guessing.** If a nested file's instruction contradicts
  this one, say so explicitly and ask — don't pick a side quietly. A wrong silent pick compounds
  every time it's followed again.
- **Reusable patterns flow up.** A convention discovered inside one app that turns out to apply
  everywhere belongs here, at the root, not copy-pasted into every app's own file — that's the same
  duplication-is-the-bug principle the rest of this document runs on.

## 1. What Senya 1st Landing Is

(to define: a one-sentence description of what this project is — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)

(to define: a short paragraph — what it does, for whom — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)

---

## 2. Operating Context

- **Team:** solo developer. Scope and sequencing must respect this bandwidth — prefer fewer,
  higher-leverage builds over broad surface area.
- **Tenancy:** single-tenant. *(If multi-tenant: every data model is tenant-aware from day one, even if
  one tenant is onboarded at a time.)*

---

## 3. Value Model (why we build anything)

Every candidate feature, integration, or stack choice must be justifiable against **at least one**
value archetype. If it can't, it waits.

(to define: the 1–3 ways this project creates value — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)

Secondary value (better decisions, momentum) is real but should be tied back to an archetype wherever
possible to keep priorities honest.

---

## 4. Decision Principles

**Evaluation axes for any tool / stack / app decision** (the north star):
**Confidence · Time-to-market · Reliability · ROI.** Nothing is dogma — everything can be analyzed and changed if the axes point
elsewhere.

**Integrate before you build.** Default to integrating or improving existing tools. Build a
replacement only when a system is (a) causing real problems, (b) costly, **and** (c) plausibly easy
to replace — judged by the axes above.

**Stage-gated architecture.** Introduce complexity (a warehouse, a queue, streaming, agents) only when
product reality justifies it — when a named trigger fires *(to define: the stage-gating triggers —
list them in `architecture/00-overview.md` during foundation)*. Premature complexity before
product-market fit is a failure mode.

**Plan before code.** Present a plan and receive **explicit approval** before writing or modifying
code. Act as a senior architect/analyst: structured analysis first, recommendations second,
implementation only after approval.

## 5. Tech & Architecture

- **Hosting / serverless:** (to define: hosting/serverless platform, or "none" — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)
- **Frontend:** (to define: frontend stack, or "none" — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)
- **Backend:** (to define: backend stack, or "none" — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)
- **Data store:** (to define: data store, or "none" — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)
- **AI:** (to define: AI stack, or "none" — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)
- **Data-access seam:** (to define: a typed data-access package name, or "n/a" — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)

**Architecture overview:** (to define: the layers + the seams that hold them apart — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)

*(to define: the project's stable seams/interfaces and core data model — settle in
`architecture/` during foundation and record each decision as an ADR.)*

---

## 6. House Engineering Standards

This is a **lessons ledger**, not a wishlist. A standard earns its place here by citing the incident
that bought it — a real defect, a real production surprise, a real "we got burned by this" — not
because it sounded like good hygiene in the abstract. When you add one, say what it replaces or what
it would have prevented; a standard with no incident behind it is a guess wearing a rule's clothes,
and it's fair game to challenge.

(to define: the engineering non-negotiables — resolve during the `qcode-charter` pass.)

- Typed result wrapper `Result<T>` for service-layer returns.
- Schema validation at every external boundary.
- Strict types across the repo.
- Structured / prefixed logs for readability.
- **No schema change without the corresponding data-access update** in the same change set.

## 7. How Claude Should Operate in This Project

### 7.1 — Senior-architect posture & the four-gate lifecycle

- **Senior architect/analyst posture:** analysis → recommendation → (approval) → implementation.
- **Plan-first discipline & the four-gate lifecycle:** never write/modify code without an approved
  plan, and never let a new product idea reach architecture planning unshaped. Four skills enforce
  one lifecycle:
  - **`product-check`** (originate) — before a new idea becomes a backlog story at all, shapes and
    gatekeeps the *requirement*: checks it against the backlog and the product map for
    duplication/fit, works through prioritization and edge cases, hands off a product-shaped story.
    Stops before architecture — that's `tech-planning`'s job next. Skips itself for work with no
    product-facing requirement (a bug fix, tech-debt paydown, Foundation-style enabler work).
  - **`tech-planning`** (plan) — before any code, turns the task into an approved backlog story
    (architecture-aligned, value archetype named, target → increment → path-to-target explicit),
    and opens the story's one branch on approval (§7.2).
  - **`tech-build`** (build) — implements *only* the approved increment on that same branch, holds
    the invariants, runs a divergence protocol so code never silently drifts from the plan, and
    delivers the story's single PR on green.
  - **`tech-qa`** (prove it's done-done) — the independent pass: compliance review + results
    verification against the story's acceptance criteria. The only gate that merges (§7.2).

### 7.2 — The delivery contract

Stated here, once. Every gate's own `SKILL.md` states only the *procedure* it executes — for the
contract itself, it links back to this section rather than restating it; if you find a gate template
describing the branch/PR/merge mechanics in its own words, that's drift from this section, not a
second source of truth.

- **One branch per story.** A story gets **exactly one** branch (`feat/<story-id>-<slug>`), opened by
  `tech-planning` on approval. `tech-build` continues on that same branch — never opens a second one.
- **One PR per story.** `tech-build` opens it, on green, once the increment is complete — not before,
  and not offered as a menu of options. That single diff carries both the plan commit and the code, so
  its own history shows the *why* next to the *what*.
- **`tech-qa` is the only gate that merges.** On a PASS, `tech-qa` itself merges to `main`, syncs, and
  deletes the branch. No other step in the lifecycle merges anything.
- **The planning-only exception.** When a `tech-planning` pass produces no code to follow (a re-plan,
  a pure decision, Foundation-style sequencing work), it commits straight to `main` instead of opening
  a branch — a branch with no `tech-build` to run on it, and no `tech-qa` to merge it, would strand
  with no owner.

### 7.3 — The canonical wrap-up sequence

One unambiguous chain, stated once:

**`product-check` → `tech-planning` → `tech-build` → PR → `tech-qa` → merge → `record-learnings`.**

`handoff` is **not** on this spine. It's opt-in, on-demand — run it only when a specific
topic/conversation is worth resuming later (or when asked), never as a routine per-story step. If you
do write one, run `record-learnings` first so the handoff can link to what it just filed.

### 7.4 — Supersession & cleanup

When a story supersedes earlier work (a redesigned seam replaces an old one, a rewritten skill retires
a prior version), **the story that supersedes closes the superseded work in the same pass** — not as
a follow-up someone might get to. Two named failure modes to avoid:

- **Closing by assumption** — marking old work superseded without checking whether anything still
  depends on it.
- **Closing by omission** — shipping the replacement and simply never circling back to close the old
  entry, leaving two "current" answers to the same question.

A story that supersedes something carries a `#### 🧹 Cleanup on close` block naming exactly what it
retires (a file, a section, a decision) and why. `tech-qa` walks this block before merging — an
unresolved cleanup item is a review finding, not a nice-to-have.

### 7.5 — The status board

**The status board is the single status surface.** [`PROJECT-STATUS.md`](PROJECT-STATUS.md) owns
status (zero duplication), updated in the same commit as the work. A `.githooks/pre-commit` guard
backstops it.

### 7.6 — Decisions, debt, questions, and the knowledge loop

- **Decisions → ADRs** ([`architecture/01-principles-and-decisions.md`](architecture/01-principles-and-decisions.md));
  **deliberate shortcuts → [`TECH-DEBT.md`](TECH-DEBT.md)** (each with a paydown trigger);
  **external blockers → [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md)**; **sessions → `handoffs/`**.
- **Close the knowledge loop (the learnings sweep).** At the close of a story (§7.3), run
  **`record-learnings`** to sweep the session for durable knowledge the in-flight gates missed and
  route each to its canonical home — see the surface-routing table below. The sweep *links*, never
  duplicates.

### 7.7 — Repo-only memory: the surface-routing table

**Every durable fact lands on a committed, versioned, repo-owned surface — never an external memory
store.** This repo has no memory the team can't see, review, or diff; if a fact doesn't fit any row
below, ask before inventing a new home rather than reaching for one that isn't committed here.

| Kind of fact | Routes to |
|---|---|
| Status (what's active, what shipped) | [`PROJECT-STATUS.md`](PROJECT-STATUS.md) / [`backlog/CLOSED.md`](backlog/CLOSED.md) |
| Plan (scope, sequencing, acceptance criteria) | [`backlog/`](backlog/) — the story/epic files |
| Shortcuts taken on purpose | [`TECH-DEBT.md`](TECH-DEBT.md), with a paydown trigger |
| External blockers | [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) |
| Architecture/technical decisions | [`architecture/01-principles-and-decisions.md`](architecture/01-principles-and-decisions.md) — an ADR |
| Product/UX facts (a surface's job, a naming convention) | [`product/decisions.md`](product/decisions.md) / [`product/screens-map.md`](product/screens-map.md) |
| Operating rules, business/domain facts, cross-session context (who the user is, standing feedback, a project constraint) | this file (`CLAUDE.md`) — always confirmed with the user before editing |
| Session narrative / open threads worth resuming | [`handoffs/`](handoffs/) — via `handoff`, on-demand only (§7.3) |

`record-learnings` is the mechanism that walks this table at the close of a story; this row set is
the same one it uses, kept in the two places deliberately (its own copy carries operational detail —
*which form* the edit takes — this one is the map itself).

### 7.8 — Session-close traceability

Before calling a session done, a later reader (a teammate, or a future Claude instance with none of
this session's context) should be able to reconstruct **why** every change happened from committed
surfaces alone — not from a chat transcript that won't exist for them. Practically: every non-trivial
decision has an ADR or a debt/question row it traces to; the board reflects reality; nothing "obvious
in context right now" was left unwritten because it felt too obvious to note.

### 7.9 — Self-serve before declaring blocked

Most things that feel blocking aren't. Before opening an `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` row or stopping to ask
the user, check whether the answer is actually derivable — from the code, the docs, git history, or a
reasonable default that can be revised later. **Only a genuine semantics call needs a human** (what
should this mean, which of two valid designs do we want) — a vendor's data shape, an existing
convention, or "what does this function already do" usually doesn't; go look before asking.

### 7.10 — Value lens

**Value lens always on:** when proposing anything, name which value archetype (§3) it serves.

### 7.11 — Token discipline: one stage, one session, right-sized model

The story file, the board, and the trackers are the durable state; the chat transcript is disposable.
Exploit that: run each lifecycle stage in a fresh context (`/clear` between stages) instead of one
marathon session — plan in one session, build in a fresh one bound to the approved story, QA in a
fresh one against the PR diff, and sweep learnings in a fresh one anchored to `git log`/diff. Never let
a working session grow past ~150K context (the cost of every later turn scales with everything
before it). Default models per stage on **Pro**: the plan's cheapest capable model for
tech-build, record-learnings, compass-check, handoff, and ad-hoc work; the plan's top-tier model for
tech-planning judgment and the tech-qa / code-review pass on high-stakes or architecture-heavy
stories; the most expensive/frontier model **only by explicit, named exception** — never a
routine-gate default. Default effort **medium**; raise only for the build/QA of complex increments.
*(to define: fill `Pro` during foundation — Pro/Max-5x/Max-20x/API — it changes how
aggressively this trade-off matters.)*
